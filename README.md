# Procedural Terrain Generator

This project is a Unity3D-based 3D procedural terrain generator I've been working on as a personal project for potential use in a game project.

## Features

 - Dynamic terrain generation - Create realistic terrain using procedural algorithms and fractional brownian motion.
 - Customization options - Fine-tune parameters to tailor the generated terrains to your specific needs.
 - Chunk loading - Terrain is generated in chunks for seamless terrain streaming and rendering.

## What's Next

 1. Continents
 2. Erosion
 3. Parallelization/GPU compute
